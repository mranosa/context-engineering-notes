# Day 1 Sprint 1: Sub-Agent Team Creation

**Duration**: 90 minutes  
**Focus**: Create your core 4-agent team  
**Acceptance Test**: 4 working sub-agents + successful coordination demo

---

## üéØ Sprint Objective

Build your essential sub-agent team that will handle all development needs across the 3-day journey.

## üìã Constraint Stack (Saturn 6H Rules)

- **Source of Truth**: [Official Sub-Agent Docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents)
- **Essential Focus**: Core agents only - frontend, backend, testing, deploy
- **Decision Time**: 10 minutes total for specializations
- **Quality Gate**: Each agent must demonstrate coordination with others

## üéØ Acceptance Criteria

### Technical Validation
- [ ] All 4 agent files created in `.claude/agents/` directory
- [ ] Each agent has proper YAML frontmatter with name, description, model, tools
- [ ] Agent specializations are clear and non-overlapping
- [ ] Claude Code recognizes all agents (check with `/agents` command)

### Coordination Validation  
- [ ] Agents respond when mentioned by name
- [ ] Multiple agents can work on same feature without conflicts
- [ ] Agents demonstrate their specialized knowledge areas
- [ ] Coordination feels natural and efficient

### Quality Validation

- [ ] Quality rules are clear and measurable
- [ ] Agent responsibilities align with their tools
- [ ] No generic or overlapping agent purposes

## üìù Pattern Documentation

```markdown
## Essential Pattern #1: Core Sub-Agent Team

**Rule**: 4 specialists cover all essential development needs
**Test**: Can agents coordinate to build complete features?
**Example**: User profile page with frontend component + backend API
**Anti-Pattern**: Generic agents that do everything
**Success Criteria**: Each agent has clear domain expertise

### Agent Specialization Matrix
| Agent | Primary Domain | Secondary Domain | Tools | Model |
|-------|----------------|------------------|-------|-------|
| frontend-expert | UI/UX, Components | Client-side logic | Read, Write, Glob, Bash | sonnet |
| backend-expert | APIs, Database | Server-side logic | Read, Write, Bash, Grep | sonnet |
| quality-expert | Testing, QA | Code review, Security | Read, Write, Bash | sonnet |
| deploy-expert | Infrastructure | CI/CD, Monitoring | Read, Write, Bash | sonnet |

### Coordination Patterns Discovered
- [ ] Sequential: backend-expert ‚Üí frontend-expert ‚Üí quality-expert
- [ ] Parallel: frontend-expert + backend-expert simultaneously  
- [ ] Review: quality-expert validates other agents' work
- [ ] Deploy: deploy-expert handles production concerns
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Agent Not Responding
```bash
# Check agent file syntax
cat .claude/agents/frontend-expert.md | head -10

# Verify YAML frontmatter
# Common issues: missing dashes, incorrect indentation
```

### Agent Confusion
```bash
# Too broad agent description - be more specific
# Example: Change "handles frontend" to "Next.js 15 components and React 19 patterns"
```

### Coordination Conflicts
```bash
# Clear domain boundaries needed
# Each agent should have distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities
```

## üéì Teaching Preparation

**Video Topic**: "Sub-Agent Team Setup" (10 minutes)

**Teaching Points**:
1. Why 4 core agents cover all development needs
2. How to create effective agent specializations  
3. Coordination patterns between agents
4. Common mistakes in agent design

**Key Takeaway**: "Specialized agents work better than generic ones - each should have clear expertise and boundaries."
