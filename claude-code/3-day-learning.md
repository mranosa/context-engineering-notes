## 📅 Day 1: Sub-Agent Foundation & Next.js 15 Setup

### ⏰ Morning Session (4 hours)

#### Hour 1: Understanding Sub-Agents & Architecture
- [ ] 📺 **MUST WATCH**: [DeepLearning.AI Claude Code Course](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/courses/claude-code-a-highly-agentic-coding-assistant/lesson/66b35/introduction) (3 mins intro)
- [ ] 📺 **VERIFIED**: [Joe Njenga's Sub-Agent Army Tutorial](https://medium.com/@joe.njenga/how-im-using-claude-code-sub-agents-newest-feature-as-my-coding-army-9598e30c1318) *(Real examples)*
- [ ] 📚 **READ**: [Official Sub-Agent Documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/sub-agents)
- [ ] ✅ Install and authenticate Claude Code with Pro/Max tier

### 🌅 Afternoon Session (4 hours)

#### Hour 5: Parallel Development with Git Worktrees

**📺 MUST WATCH**: [Parallel AI Coding with Git Worktrees](https://docs.agentinterviews.com/blog/parallel-ai-coding-with-gitworktrees/) *(Verified tutorial)*

**✅ STEP 1: Understand Git Worktrees**
Using git worktrees enables you to run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously on different parts of your project, each focused on its own independent task

```bash
# In your main project directory
git worktree add ../nextjs-feature-auth feature-auth
git worktree add ../nextjs-feature-dashboard feature-dashboard
git worktree add ../nextjs-feature-api feature-api

# List all worktrees
git worktree list
```

**✅ STEP 3: Set Up Parallel Development**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Authentication feature
cd ../nextjs-feature-auth
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> Use frontend-expert and backend-expert to build a complete authentication system with NextAuth.js v5

# Terminal 2: Dashboard feature  
cd ../nextjs-feature-dashboard
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> Use frontend-expert to create a responsive dashboard with data visualization components

# Terminal 3: API development
cd ../nextjs-feature-api
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
> Use backend-expert to design and implement tRPC endpoints for user and content management
```

#### Hour 6: Advanced Sub-Agent Prompting Techniques

**✅ EXPLICIT SUB-AGENT INVOCATION EXAMPLES:**

```bash
# 1. Specific sub-agent for specific task
> Use the frontend-expert subagent to create a modern landing page with hero section, features, and CTA

# 2. Multiple sub-agents coordination
> Have frontend-expert create the UI components and backend-expert create the API, then testing-expert add comprehensive tests

# 3. Sub-agent with detailed requirements
> Ask the backend-expert subagent to:
> - Design a User model with Prisma
> - Create CRUD API endpoints
> - Add proper validation with Zod
> - Implement error handling
> - Add database indexing for performance

# 4. Proactive sub-agent usage (they work automatically)
> I'm building a blog feature. Make it production-ready.
# Claude will automatically delegate to appropriate sub-agents

# 5. Sub-agent review and iteration
> Use the testing-expert to review the authentication code and add any missing test cases
```

#### Hour 7: Enterprise CLAUDE.md with Sub-Agent Coordination

**✅ CREATE ENTERPRISE CLAUDE.MD**
```bash
cat > CLAUDE.md << 'EOF'
# Enterprise Next.js 15 Full-Stack Application

## Project Overview
This is an enterprise-scale Next.js 15 application with React 19, built using a monorepo architecture with Turborepo. The application includes user authentication, dashboards, admin panels, and comprehensive API management.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router, React 19, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: tRPC, Prisma, PostgreSQL, NextAuth.js v5
- **Monorepo**: Turborepo with pnpm workspaces
- **Testing**: Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel with proper environment management

## Sub-Agent Coordination Rules

### Automatic Delegation Patterns
When implementing features, Claude will automatically delegate to:
- **frontend-expert**: UI components, pages, client-side logic
- **backend-expert**: API routes, database operations, server-side logic  
- **testing-expert**: Test coverage, quality assurance
- **devops-expert**: Deployment, CI/CD, infrastructure

### Task Coordination Guidelines
1. **Feature Development**: Start with backend-expert for data models, then frontend-expert for UI, finally testing-expert for coverage
2. **Bug Fixes**: Use appropriate specialist based on the bug location
3. **Performance**: Coordinate between frontend-expert and backend-expert for optimization
4. **Deployment**: Always involve devops-expert for production changes

### Quality Gates
- **MUST** have tests written by testing-expert for all new features
- **MUST** have proper TypeScript types in all components
- **MUST** follow Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- **MUST** implement proper error boundaries and loading states

## Next.js 15 Specific Rules
- **ALWAYS** use App Router (never Pages Router)
- **MUST** properly separate Server Components from Client Components
- **USE** React 19 actions for form submissions
- **IMPLEMENT** proper metadata API for SEO
- **LEVERAGE** Turbopack for development

## Development Workflow Commands

### Multi-Agent Coordination
- `qplan-enterprise`: Plan complex features with sub-agent coordination
- `qcode-parallel`: Execute parallel development across sub-agents
- `qcheck-enterprise`: Comprehensive quality review across all agents
- `qdeploy`: Coordinate deployment with proper testing

### Sub-Agent Invocation Examples
```
Use frontend-expert to create a responsive user profile page
Have backend-expert implement user management APIs with proper validation  
Ask testing-expert to add comprehensive test coverage for authentication
Get devops-expert to set up staging environment deployment
```

## Parallel Development with Worktrees
When working on multiple features:
1. Create separate worktrees for independent features
2. Run Claude sessions in parallel terminals
3. Use sub-agents in each worktree for specialized tasks
4. Merge completed features back to main branch

## Error Handling & Recovery
- If a sub-agent makes mistakes, explicitly invoke testing-expert for validation
- Use devops-expert for deployment issues
- Coordinate between agents when features need integration

## Performance & Cost Management
- Use `model: sonnet` for most tasks (cost-effective)
- Use `model: opus` only for complex architecture decisions
- Clear context with `/clear` when switching between major features
- Use specific sub-agents to avoid over-broad context

# Each step waits for the previous to complete
```

# When tasks can run in parallel but need integration:
> Parallel Development:
> - frontend-expert: Build dashboard UI components
> - backend-expert: Create analytics API endpoints
> - database-architect: Optimize analytics queries
> - bi-specialist: Design KPI calculations
>
> Integration Phase:
> - Coordinate all sub-agents to integrate components
> - testing-expert: Add integration tests
> - devops-expert: Deploy integrated solution
```

#### Pattern 3: Iterative with Feedback
```bash
# For complex features requiring iteration:
> Iteration 1: Build MVP with all sub-agents
> Review and feedback session
> Iteration 2: Enhance based on feedback
> Review and feedback session  
> Iteration 3: Final optimization and polish
> Final review and production deployment
```

### Sub-Agent Performance Monitoring

#### Tracking Sub-Agent Effectiveness
```bash
# Monitor sub-agent performance:
> Analyze sub-agent coordination effectiveness:
> 1. Which agents complete tasks fastest?
> 2. Where are handoff bottlenecks occurring?
> 3. What coordination patterns work best?
> 4. How can we improve agent specialization?
> 5. What additional agents would be beneficial?
```

#### Optimizing Sub-Agent Prompts
```bash
# Improve sub-agent performance:
> Review and optimize sub-agent prompts for:
> - Clarity of responsibilities
> - Proper tool access permissions
> - Coordination guidelines
> - Quality standards
> - Performance expectations
```
