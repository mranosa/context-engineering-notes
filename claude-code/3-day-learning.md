## 🛠️ Essential Code Templates

### TypeScript CLAUDE.md Template
```markdown
# TypeScript Project Guidelines

## Tech Stack
- TypeScript 5.0+
- Node.js/React/Next.js
- Testing: Jest/Vitest

## TypeScript Rules
- **MUST** Use strict mode
- **MUST** Prefer `type` over `interface` unless extending
- **MUST** Use branded types for IDs: `type UserId = Brand<string, 'UserId'>`
- **MUST** Use `import type { ... }` for type-only imports
- **SHOULD** Avoid `any` - use `unknown` or proper generics
- **SHOULD** Use const assertions for immutable data

## Code Style
- Functional programming preferred
- No classes unless absolutely necessary
- Descriptive type names: `UserProfile` not `User`
- Use utility types: `Partial<T>`, `Pick<T, K>`, etc.

## Shortcuts
### QPLAN
Analyze similar TypeScript patterns and ensure:
- Type safety is maintained
- Follows established interface contracts
- Reuses existing type definitions

### QCODE  
Implement with TypeScript best practices:
- Run `tsc --noEmit` for type checking
- Run `eslint --fix` for code style
- Ensure all tests pass with `npm test`
- Generate proper JSDoc for public APIs

### QCHECK
Review TypeScript-specific concerns:
- Are types as narrow as possible?
- Are there any implicit `any` types?
- Is the type complexity justified?
- Are generics properly constrained?
```

### Essential Commands
```bash
# Start Claude Code
claude

# Essential shortcuts in Claude
/clear                                    # Clear context (use often!)
/init                                     # Initialize project understanding
@filename                                 # Reference specific files
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions     # Skip permission prompts

# Custom shortcuts (after setting up CLAUDE.md)
qplan     # Analyze and plan TypeScript patterns
qcode     # Implement with best practices
qcheck    # Review code quality
qgit      # Commit with proper messages
```

### TypeScript Patterns to Practice
```typescript
// Branded types for better type safety
type UserId = Brand<string, 'UserId'>
type Email = Brand<string, 'Email'>

// Advanced utility types
type ApiResponse<T> = {
  data: T
  error?: string
  loading: boolean
}

// Discriminated unions for state management
type LoadingState = 
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'loading' }
  | { status: 'success'; data: any }
  | { status: 'error'; error: string }

// Template literal types
type EventName = `on${Capitalize<string>}`

// Mapped types with key remapping
type Getters<T> = {
  [K in keyof T as `get${Capitalize<string & K>}`]: () => T[K]
}

// Conditional types for API responses
type ApiResult<T> = T extends string 
  ? { message: T }
  : { data: T }
```

## 💡 Pro Tips for TypeScript Engineers

### Mental Models
1. **Think Orchestrator, Not Coder**: Treat Claude as your TypeScript expert who implements your architectural decisions
2. **Type-First Development**: Start with interfaces, let Claude implement the logic
3. **Compiler as QA**: Use TypeScript errors to guide Claude's corrections

### Critical Success Habits
- Always use `/clear` when starting new tasks
- Set up proper CLAUDE.md for project context
- Use `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` for efficiency
- Review all generated code for type safety
- Test complex type manipulations thoroughly

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Accepting First Drafts**: Always iterate on Claude's initial implementations
2. **Vague Type Requirements**: Be specific about type constraints
3. **Overcomplicating Types**: Keep type complexity justified by use case
4. **Ignoring Bundle Size**: Use type-only imports properly
